## Task Estimations

In terms of task estimations, my accuracy varied throughout the course of the subject. Initially, I found it challenging to accurately gauge the time required for certain tasks. However, as the subject progressed, I began to develop a better understanding of the complexity of different tasks, which led to improved accuracy in my estimations.

## Code Reviews

### Learning from Reviews

From both being reviewed and conducting reviews, I've gained valuable insights into different coding styles, best practices, and approaches to problem-solving. It's been enlightening to see how others tackle similar problems, which has broadened my perspective and improved my own coding skills.

### Providing Reviews

Providing code reviews has allowed me to practice giving constructive feedback and identifying areas for improvement. It's also helped me appreciate the importance of clear and well-documented code, as it facilitates easier reviews and collaboration among team members.

## Subject Management

If I were in charge of the subject, there are a few changes I would consider implementing:

- **Interactive Workshops**: Introducing interactive workshops or coding sessions focused on specific topics to reinforce understanding.

## Exemplary Code Reviews

Here are two pull requests where I provided substantial code reviews:

1. [Link to PR #1]([https://github.com/Shoonleiphyu/PycharmProjects/pull/9])
2. [Link to PR #2]([https://github.com/Shoonleiphyu/PycharmProjects/pull/11])
