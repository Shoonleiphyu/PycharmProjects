# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains my practical exercises and projects for the CP1404 subject. It showcases my progress and learning throughout the course.

## About Me
I am Shoon Lei Phyu, a student enrolled in CP1404 at James Cook University. This repository reflects my efforts in learning Python programming and software development.

## Clean Code Lessons
Throughout this subject, I've learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

1. **Consistent Formatting**: Consistency in code formatting, including indentation, variable naming, and code style, improves readability and maintainability.

2. **Modularization**: Breaking down code into smaller, reusable functions and classes promotes code reusability and makes debugging easier.

3. **Documentation**: Clear and concise comments and docstrings are essential to explain code functionality, especially for complex or non-intuitive parts of the code.
